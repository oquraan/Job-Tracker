# Lab 10: Job Tracker

##  Objective
Build a React application where users can register/login and manage their job applications using **Firebase Firestore**.  
Users should be able to **create, read, update, delete (CRUD)** and **filter** applications by status.

Statuses include:
- Applied
- Interview
- Rejected
- Hired

The app uses **Redux Toolkit** for state management and **Redux Persist** to store state locally.


##  Features
-  **Authentication** – Register/Login with Firebase Auth.
-  **Job Applications CRUD** – Add, edit, delete, and list job applications in Firestore.
-  **Filtering** – Filter applications by status (applied, interview, rejected, hired).
-  **Persistent State** – Redux Persist keeps state after refresh.
-  **UI Components** – Modern React components styled with Material UI / Tailwind (depending on your stack).


##  Tech Stack
- **React** (Frontend)
- **Firebase Auth + Firestore** (Authentication & Database)
- **Redux Toolkit** (State Management)
- **Redux Persist** (Local Persistence)
- **Material UI
